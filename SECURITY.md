# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities **privately** so we can fix them before public disclosure.

- Preferred: open a **private security advisory** in the repository (GitHub → *Security* → *Advisories*).
- Alternative: email the maintainers at **[replace-with-security-email]**.

We aim to acknowledge reports within **5 business days** and fix valid issues as soon as practical.
