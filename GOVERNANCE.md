# Project Governance

This document describes how decisions are made in the whyx project.

## Roles

- **Maintainers**: merge PRs, cut releases, enforce the Code of Conduct.
- **Contributors**: anyone sending PRs or opening issues.
- **Users**: anyone using the project.

## Decision Making

- Small/low-risk changes: any maintainer may approve and merge after one review.
- Larger changes (new commands, breaking changes): require **2+ maintainer approvals** and a short design note in the PR.
- Disagreements: aim for consensus; failing that, a simple maintainer majority decides.

## Adding/Removing Maintainers

- Nominated by an existing maintainer and confirmed by simple majority.
- Inactivity or conduct violations may result in removal by majority vote.

## Releases

- Maintainers tag releases and update `CHANGELOG.md`.
